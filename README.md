# CartoonifyCV-App
This project is a computer vision application that transforms real-world images into various stylized formats, including cartoon, pencil sketch, watercolor, and color sketch effects. Leveraging technologies such as OpenCV, Flask, and JavaScript, the application provides an interactive web interface where users can upload images and select the desired transformation effect. The backend processes the images using advanced image processing techniques such as color quantization, adaptive thresholding, and smoothing to generate artful renditions of the input photographs.

## Overview
CartoonifyCV-App is an interactive web-based application that converts standard images into a variety of artistic styles such as cartoons, pencil sketches, watercolor, and color sketches. This project combines computer vision and web technologies to provide a user-friendly platform for image stylization.
